## **Introduction**

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the presence of lung cancer based on given input features. The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model training and evaluation
4. Prediction and result analysis

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages `pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AhmedAlaa4611/Lung-Cancer-Prediction.git
    cd lung-cancer-prediction
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install seaborn
    pip install scikit-learn

    ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `lung cancer.ipynb` notebook.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to lung cancer diagnosis. Ensure you have the dataset file in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path in the notebook accordingly.

## **Usage**

Run the cells in the Jupyter notebook sequentially to:
1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the models.
5. Make predictions and analyze the results.

## **Project Structure**

- `lung cancer.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the code and documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing the required Python packages.
- `data/`: A directory to place the dataset file (update the path in the notebook if needed).

## **Results**

The results of the model training and evaluation, including performance metrics and visualizations, are documented within the notebook. Example outputs include:
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
